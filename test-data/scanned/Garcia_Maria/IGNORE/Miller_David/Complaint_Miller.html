        <p class="mb-4">Plaintiff, DAVID MILLER (“Plaintiff”), by and through his undersigned counsel, brings this action against Defendants AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY (“American Express”), and TRANS UNION, LLC (“Trans Union”), and alleges the following:</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-center my-4">PRELIMINARY STATEMENT</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">1. This is an action for damages arising from Defendants’ reporting of inaccurate information on Plaintiff’s credit report and their failure to conduct a reasonable investigation into his disputes.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">2. Defendants are reporting a late payment on an American Express account that was, in fact, paid on time.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">3. As a result of this single inaccuracy, Plaintiff’s credit score dropped significantly, causing him to be denied a favorable interest rate on a personal loan.</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-center my-4">JURISDICTION AND VENUE</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">4. Jurisdiction is conferred by 15 U.S.C. § 1681p and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">5. Venue is proper in this District as Plaintiff resides here and the harm occurred here.</p>
        
        <h3 class="font-bold text-center my-4">PARTIES</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">6. Plaintiff, David Miller, is a natural person residing in the borough of Brooklyn, State of New York.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">7. Defendant American Express Company is a “furnisher of information” under the FCRA.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">8. Defendant Trans Union, LLC is a “consumer reporting agency” as defined by the FCRA.</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-center my-4">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">9. On March 15, 2025, Plaintiff made a timely payment to his American Express account. Due to a processing error on the part of American Express, the payment was not credited to his account until March 18, 2025, making it appear as if he was three days late.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">10. American Express subsequently furnished this inaccurate "30 days late" information to Trans Union, who then reported it on Plaintiff's credit report.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">11. On April 10, 2025, Plaintiff disputed the late payment with both American Express and Trans Union, providing a copy of his bank statement showing the payment was made on time.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">12. Both Defendants failed to conduct a reasonable investigation. American Express simply verified the date the payment was posted, not the date it was made. Trans Union merely "parroted" this incorrect verification.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">13. The inaccurate late payment remains on his Trans Union credit report, damaging his creditworthiness.</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-center my-4">CAUSE OF ACTION - VIOLATIONS OF THE FCRA</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">14. Plaintiff realleges all prior paragraphs.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">15. Trans Union willfully or negligently violated 15 U.S.C. § 1681e(b) and § 1681i.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">16. American Express willfully or negligently violated 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b).</p>
        <p class="mb-4">17. As a result of these violations, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages and is entitled to actual, statutory, and punitive damages, plus attorney's fees and costs.</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-center my-4">DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Plaintiff demands a trial by jury.</p>
