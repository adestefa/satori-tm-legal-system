        <h2 class="font-bold mb-4">Regarding your application for a Capital One Auto Loan</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Dear Maria Garcia,</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Thank you for your recent auto loan application. After careful consideration, we are unable to approve your application for the amount requested. However, we can offer you a loan with the following terms:</p>
        <ul class="list-none my-4 ml-4 space-y-1 bg-gray-100 p-3">
            <li>Loan Amount: $15,000</li>
            <li>Interest Rate: 22.5% APR</li>
            <li>Term: 60 months</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">This decision was based on information from your credit report. The primary factors influencing our decision were:</p>
        <ul class="list-none my-4 ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>A seriously delinquent account with a high balance.</li>
            <li>Limited credit history.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The consumer reporting agency that provided us with information is:</p>
        <div class="my-4 p-4 border border-dashed">
            <p class="font-bold">Experian</p>
            <p>P.O. Box 2002</p>

            <p>1-888-397-3742</p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">About your credit score</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">We also obtained a credit score from Experian and used it in making our decision.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Your FICO® Score was <strong>580</strong> on <strong>06/12/2025</strong>. FICO® Scores range from 300 to 850.</p>
            <p>The key factors that adversely affected your score were a serious delinquency and the high balance on a major credit card.</p>

        <div class="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-8 border-t pt-4">
             <p>The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The federal agency that administers compliance with this law concerning this creditor is the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 1700 G Street NW., Washington DC 20552.</p>
