            <p><strong>Client:</strong> John Chen</p>
            <p><strong>Contact:</strong> 646-555-8899</p>
            <p><strong>Location:</strong> Manhattan, NY</p>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Mixed credit file with a "Jonathan Chen" from Flushing, NY. Experian is merging the two files.</p>

            <p><strong>Inaccurate Account:</strong> Citibank card with $15k balance, plus a bankruptcy from 2022. None of this belongs to our client.</p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Client was trying to buy a condo. Had a deal in place.</li>
                <li>Denied for a mortgage by Chase on May 15, 2025 due to the bad info on his Experian report.</li>
                <li>He sent a dispute to Experian on May 20, 2025 with his DL, SS card, and a ConEd bill. Very clear evidence.</li>
                <li>Experian and Citibank both "verified" the bad info. This is a clear failure to follow reasonable procedures.</li>
                <li>The seller of the condo backed out because of the delay. Client lost the apartment.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Lost Housing Opportunity:</strong> Lost the condo he was under contract to buy. Have the mortgage denial letter from Chase.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Distress:</strong> Extremely upset and stressed. Feels helpless.</li>
                <li><strong>Reputational Harm:</strong> Was made to look like a deadbeat by the credit report.</li>
