        <h2 class="font-bold mb-4">Regarding your mortgage application for property at 123 Main Street, Apt 4B, New York, NY</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Dear John Chen,</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Thank you for choosing Chase for your home financing needs. After a thorough review of your application and credit information, we are sorry to inform you that we cannot approve your mortgage application at this time. This decision was based on the following factors:</p>
        <ul class="list-none my-4 ml-4 space-y-1 bg-gray-100 p-3">
            <li>A collection account was reported on your credit file.</li>
            <li>A previous bankruptcy was reported.</li>
            <li>The debt-to-income ratio, including the reported delinquent debt, exceeds our lending guidelines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our decision was based in whole or in part on information obtained from a consumer reporting agency:</p>
        <div class="my-4 p-4 border border-dashed">
            <p class="font-bold">Experian</p>
            <p>P.O. Box 2002</p>
            <p>Allen, TX 75013</p>
            <p>1-888-397-3742</p>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-4">The reporting agency did not make the decision to deny your loan and cannot provide the specific reasons for the denial. You have the right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to obtain a free copy of your credit report from the agency if you request it within 60 days. You also have the right to dispute any information in the report that you believe is inaccurate.</p>
        <div class="mt-6">
            <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Information about your credit score</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">We also obtained a credit score from Experian and used it in our decision. </p>
            <p class="mb-2">Your FICOÂ® Score was <strong>620</strong> on <strong>05/14/2025</strong>. Scores range from 300-850. </p>
            <p>Key factors that adversely affected your score included a collection account, a public record (bankruptcy), and the high balance on a delinquent credit card.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-8 border-t pt-4">
             <p>The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The federal agency that administers compliance with this law concerning this creditor is the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 1700 G Street NW., Washington DC 20552.</p>
