History:
Client has a very good credit history otherwise.
Discovered the issue when applying for a car loan in April 2025.
Sent written disputes to Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion around Feb 15, 2025.
Dispute letters included a copy of his driver's license (showing middle initial 'M') and social security card to prove his identity.
