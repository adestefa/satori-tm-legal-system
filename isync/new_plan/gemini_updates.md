# TM iSync Adapter - Gemini Updates (July 17, 2025)

**Project:** iSync Usability and Server Integration  
**Branch:** `feature/gemini-sync-upload`  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the work completed to enhance the Tiger-Monkey (TM) iSync Adapter. The primary goals were to transition from a local file-copy mechanism to a robust client-server model by uploading files directly to the TM Dashboard service, and to significantly improve the user experience by providing a simple, double-clickable application with real-time feedback.

The new architecture achieves a professional, user-friendly workflow without the overhead of native macOS application development, notarization, or App Store distribution.

## Phase 1: Go Adapter Enhancements

The core Go application (`isync/adapter`) was modified to act as a client that sends files to the central server instead of accessing the local file system directly.

### 1.1. Configuration Update (`config.go`)

The configuration schema was updated to support the new client-server model.

-   **Removed:** `LocalTMPath` field is no longer needed.
-   **Added:**
    -   `ApiEndpoint`: The URL of the TM Dashboard's new file upload endpoint.
    -   `ApiKey`: A placeholder for a security token to authenticate with the dashboard.

The `DefaultConfig()` and `validateConfig()` functions were updated accordingly.

### 1.2. Implemented File Upload Logic (`sync.go`)

The core synchronization logic was rewritten to upload files.

-   **New `uploadFile` function:**
    -   Creates a `multipart/form-data` HTTP POST request.
    -   Includes the file content and its `relative_path`.
    -   Sets the `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` header for security.
    -   Sends the request to the configured `ApiEndpoint`.
    -   Handles HTTP responses and errors.
-   **Modified `uploadICloudFiles` (previously `syncICloudToTM`):**
    -   This function now iterates through files in the iCloud directory and calls `uploadFile` for each new or modified file.
-   **Improved Logging:** Log messages were enhanced to be more descriptive and user-friendly, providing clear status updates like "Uploading file..." and "File uploaded successfully".

### 1.3. Main Application Updates (`main.go`)

Minor updates were made to the main application entry point to align with the new configuration and logic.

-   Updated configuration logging to show the new `api_endpoint`.
-   Removed validation for the now-obsolete `LocalTMPath`.
-   Updated the status reporter to use the new `FilesUploaded` metric.

## Phase 2: User-Facing Wrapper

To improve usability, a simple yet elegant wrapper was created to launch the Go adapter.

### 2.1. `run.sh` Script

A new shell script was created at `isync/adapter/run.sh`.

-   **Functionality:**
    -   Changes to the script's directory to ensure the Go binary is found.
    -   Prints a professional header with the service name and version.
    -   Provides real-time status messages to the user (e.g., "Service initiated...", "Monitoring iCloud folder...").
    -   Executes the `tm-isync-adapter` binary.
-   **Permissions:** The script was made executable (`chmod +x`).

### 2.2. `run.applescript` and `run.app`

An AppleScript was created to provide a native-like application feel.

-   **File:** `isync/adapter/run.applescript`
-   **Functionality:**
    -   When run, it opens a new macOS **Terminal** window.
    -   It automatically executes the `run.sh` script inside the new terminal window.
-   **Application Bundle (`run.app`):**
    -   The user can open this AppleScript in the "Script Editor" app on macOS and export it as an **Application**. This creates a `run.app` file that can be double-clicked, have a custom icon, and be placed on the Desktop or in the Dock for easy access.

## Phase 3: Dashboard and Packaging Updates

The TM Dashboard was updated to support the new client-server architecture.

### 3.1. New File Upload Endpoint (`dashboard/main.py`)

A new API endpoint was added to the FastAPI application:

-   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/icloud/upload`
-   **Functionality:**
    -   Accepts `multipart/form-data` requests.
    -   Expects a `file` and a `relative_path` field.
    -   Performs security checks to prevent path traversal attacks (`..`).
    -   Saves the uploaded file to the correct destination within the `test-data/sync-test-cases` directory, preserving the original folder structure.
    -   Returns a JSON response indicating success or failure.

### 3.2. Updated Download Package Logic (`dashboard/main.py`)

The logic for the `POST /api/icloud/download-package` endpoint was updated:

-   When generating the `config.json` for the Go adapter, it now dynamically includes the correct `api_endpoint` based on the request's host.
-   The `local_tm_path` field is no longer included in the generated configuration.
-   The generated `.tar.gz` package now includes the new `run.sh` and `run.applescript` files, providing the user with a complete, ready-to-run solution.

## Conclusion

These updates successfully transform the iSync adapter into a more robust and user-friendly tool. The move to a client-server model decouples the adapter from the local TM file structure, making it more flexible. The AppleScript wrapper provides an excellent user experience with real-time feedback, meeting the project's goals without introducing the complexity of native application development.
