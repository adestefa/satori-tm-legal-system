# CORRECT SIMPLE FLOW

## What You're Missing: NOTHING! 
**You have the correct understanding. The current implementation is wrong.**

## The Right Way (Super Simple)

### 1. User Clicks "Process Files" 
- Dashboard shows: ⏳ **Processing...**
- Dashboard calls Tiger API: `POST /api/process-case`
- Tiger does ALL the work (parsing, validation, extraction)

### 2. Tiger Processes Documents
- Tiger parses DOCX files
- Tiger validates content
- Tiger extracts structured data
- Tiger generates hydrated JSON
- Tiger returns: `{"status": "success", "json_path": "..."}`

### 3. Dashboard Shows Results
- Remove ⏳ **Processing...**
- Show: ✅ **Processed** (if success)
- Show: ❌ **Error** (if failure)
- User can now click "Review" to see extracted data

## Current BROKEN Flow

```
❌ User clicks "Validate & Process"
❌ Dashboard tries to validate DOCX files itself  
❌ Dashboard shows validation errors BEFORE processing
❌ User has to "fix" things that Tiger should handle
❌ Finally calls Tiger to process (if validation passes)
```

## Correct SIMPLE Flow

```
✅ User clicks "Process Files"
✅ Dashboard shows ⏳ "Processing documents..."
✅ Dashboard calls Tiger API
✅ Tiger does everything (parse, validate, extract)
✅ Dashboard shows result (success/error)
✅ User clicks "Review" to see extracted data
```

## What Needs to Change

### Remove from Dashboard:
- ❌ All document parsing (`extract_text_from_docx`)
- ❌ All validation logic (`validate_case_data`)
- ❌ All "Validate & Process" buttons
- ❌ All validation error displays

### Keep in Dashboard:
- ✅ "Process Files" button
- ✅ ⏳ Processing spinner
- ✅ ✅/❌ Success/error status
- ✅ "Review" button (after processing)

### Tiger Does Everything:
- ✅ Parse documents
- ✅ Validate content
- ✅ Extract data
- ✅ Generate JSON
- ✅ Return success/error

## Simple Button Labels

### Before Processing:
- Button: **"Process Files"**
- Status: **"New"**

### During Processing:
- Button: **⏳ "Processing..."** (disabled)
- Status: **"Processing"**

### After Success:
- Button: **"Review & Generate"**
- Status: **"Pending Review"**

### After Error:
- Button: **"Process Files"** (retry)
- Status: **"Error"**

## Why Current Flow is Wrong

1. **Dashboard shouldn't validate** - That's Tiger's job
2. **No pre-processing validation** - Just let Tiger try and handle errors
3. **Too many steps** - One click should do everything
4. **User confusion** - Why validate before processing?

## The Fix

1. **Remove all validation from Dashboard**
2. **Change button to "Process Files"**
3. **Show spinner during Tiger processing**
4. **Display Tiger's results (success/error)**
5. **Let Tiger handle all document issues**

**Bottom Line: Dashboard = UI, Tiger = Processing. Keep it simple!**
