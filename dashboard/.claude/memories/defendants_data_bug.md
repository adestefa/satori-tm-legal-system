# Analysis of the Persistent Defendant Data Rendering Bug

## 1. Problem Statement

The objective is to fix a UI bug on the `/review` page where the `Defendants` field renders as a list of `[object Object]` strings instead of the defendants' names.

A logical fix was implemented in `dashboard/static/review/js/review.js` to correctly iterate over the defendants array and render the `name` property of each object. However, despite multiple server restarts and browser refreshes, the UI continues to exhibit the original buggy behavior, indicating that the updated JavaScript file is not being loaded by the browser.

## 2. Analysis of the Execution Stack

To understand the failure, I have traced the flow of the relevant static asset from the file system to the browser:

1.  **Browser Request:** The user navigates to the review page. The browser parses the main HTML and issues a `GET` request for the JavaScript file, e.g., `GET /static/review/js/review.js`.

2.  **FastAPI Server (Uvicorn):** The Uvicorn server, running the FastAPI application, receives the request.

3.  **Static Files Middleware:** The request is routed to FastAPI's `StaticFiles` middleware, which is responsible for serving files from the `dashboard/static/` directory.

4.  **File System Read:** The middleware is expected to read the `review.js` file from the disk at `/Users/corelogic/satori-dev/TM/dashboard/static/review/js/review.js`.

5.  **Server Response:** The server sends the content of the file back to the browser.

6.  **Browser Execution:** The browser executes the received JavaScript, which then makes API calls and renders the data.

## 3. Hypothesis for Failure

The evidence strongly suggests a **caching issue**. The correct, patched version of `review.js` exists on the file system, but the old, buggy version is being served to the browser. The failure point lies between steps 3 and 5 of the execution stack.

*   **Hypothesis A: Browser Cache.** This was my initial theory. However, a forced/hard refresh typically resolves this, and it has not. While still a possibility, it is less likely to be the sole cause after repeated attempts.

*   **Hypothesis B: Server-Side Caching.** This is the most probable cause. The web server process itself (Uvicorn/FastAPI) is likely holding a cached version of the static file in memory. When a file on disk is updated, the server does not always invalidate its in-memory cache, especially for static assets in a development environment.

## 4. Proposed Action and Rationale

My next proposed action was to **delete the `dashboard/__pycache__` directory.**

### Rationale:

The FastAPI application is composed of Python modules. For performance, Python compiles these modules into bytecode (`.pyc` files) and stores them in `__pycache__` directories.

The logic that serves static files is itself part of a Python module (`StaticFiles` from the Starlette library). It is possible, though less common, that the *Python module responsible for serving the file* is running from stale bytecode. This cached bytecode might contain outdated logic about how it reads or caches files from the disk.

By deleting the `__pycache__` directory, we force Python to discard all old bytecode for the dashboard application. On the next server start, Python will re-read all `.py` source files and recompile them into fresh bytecode.

This action is a standard and safe troubleshooting step that definitively eliminates stale Python code as the source of the problem. It ensures that the server is running the absolute latest version of all application logic, including the logic for serving static assets. This is the most logical way to invalidate any potential server-side code caching and force the server to re-evaluate its static file handling.
