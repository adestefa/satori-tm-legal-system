## Issue: Dashboard Review Page Missing Data for Youssef Case

### Observations
- Navigated to the dashboard, which correctly displayed the "Youssef" case with an "Error" status.
- Manually navigated to the review page for the Youssef case.
- The review page loaded, but the "Parties" section was empty. Other sections appeared to have data.

### Diagnosis
- A screenshot of the page confirmed the missing data in the UI.
- Console logs revealed that the API call to `/api/cases/youssef/data` was successful (HTTP 200).
- The JSON response from the API, captured in the console logs, showed that the `parties` object was empty. Specifically, the `plaintiff` object was empty and the `defendants` array was empty.
- This indicates that the error is not in the dashboard's frontend code, but rather in the data being provided by the backend.

### Conclusion
The root cause of the issue is that the Tiger service is failing to extract the plaintiff and defendant information from the source documents for the Youssef case. The dashboard is accurately reflecting the incomplete data it receives from the API. The problem lies within the Tiger service's data extraction logic.
