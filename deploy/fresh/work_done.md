# VPS Deployment - Work Completed
**Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL**  
**Target**: Production VPS legal-agent-vps (66.228.34.12)

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. JavaScript "htmlResponse is not defined" Error ✅
**Problem**: Dashboard complaint generation failing with variable scope error
- **File**: `/opt/tm/dashboard/static/js/review.js:811`
- **Root Cause**: Variable `htmlResponse` declared inside try-catch block but used outside scope
- **Solution**: Moved variable declaration outside try-catch block for proper scoping
- **Git Commit**: `4b938c3` - "fix: resolve JavaScript variable scope issue and summons generation address bug"

### 2. Summons "Address Not Available" Error ✅
**Problem**: Summons generation showing "Address not available" despite hardcoded creditor address directory
- **File**: `/opt/tm/monkey/core/summons_generator.py`
- **Root Cause**: Code looking for 'creditors' key but JSON had 'creditor_addresses' key structure
- **Solution**: Updated JSON structure references and enhanced creditor address matching logic
- **Verification**: 18 summons documents generated successfully for Rodriguez case

### 3. Cross-Platform Cases.sh Script Compatibility ✅
**Problem**: Script failing on Linux VPS due to macOS BSD stat commands
- **File**: `/opt/tm/scripts/cases.sh`
- **Root Cause**: macOS BSD `stat -f` commands incompatible with Linux GNU `stat -c`
- **Solution**: Implemented auto-detection with conditional command mapping
- **Features Added**:
  - OS detection function `detect_os_and_set_stat_commands()`
  - Conditional stat command variables based on detected OS
  - Seamless operation on both macOS and Linux systems

### 4. VPS Infrastructure Issues ✅
**Problem**: Multiple permission and configuration issues on production VPS
- **Tiger Log Directory**: Created `/opt/tm/tiger/data/logs/` with proper permissions
- **Version.js Permissions**: Fixed write permissions for dashboard version file
- **Git Conflicts**: Resolved local changes conflicting with deployment updates

## Technical Verification Results

### Tiger Service ✅

```

### Monkey Service ✅
```bash
# Document Generation
- 18 summons documents generated successfully
- Creditor address file loaded correctly (JSON format validated)
- Template processing working across all defendant types
- Output directory: /opt/tm/outputs/monkey/summons/
```

### Dashboard Service ✅

```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Git Repository Synchronization
```bash
# Local to Remote Push
git add . && git commit -m "fix: resolve JavaScript variable scope issue and summons generation address bug"
git push origin main

# VPS Update Process
ssh root@legal-agent-vps "cd /opt/tm && git stash push -m 'VPS local changes before deploy'"
ssh root@legal-agent-vps "cd /opt/tm && git pull origin main"
# Fast-forward successful: 487bd7f..4b938c3
```

### 2. Service Management
```bash
# Dashboard Service Restart
sudo systemctl restart tm-dashboard
sudo systemctl status tm-dashboard  # ✅ Active (running)

# Permission Fixes Applied
chmod 755 /opt/tm/tiger/data/logs/
chmod 644 /opt/tm/dashboard/static/version.js
```

### 3. End-to-End Testing
```bash
# Complete Workflow Verification
1. Tiger processing: Rodriguez case ✅
2. Monkey generation: 18 summons documents ✅  
3. Dashboard accessibility: http://66.228.34.12:8000 ✅
4. Cross-platform script: cases.sh working on Linux ✅
```

- Nginx reverse proxy configuration  
- HTTPS redirection and security headers
- Automatic certificate renewal via cron/systemd

### Domain and Routing Setup (High Priority)
- DNS updates to point legal.satori-ai-tech.com to 66.228.34.12
- Tenant subdomain routing (/mallon/) configuration
- Production URL structure implementation

### Security Hardening (Medium Priority)
- SSL/TLS configuration testing
- Security headers validation
- Access control verification
- Certificate renewal monitoring

**Current Status**: Core application functionality ✅ **COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**  
**Next Phase**: SSL certificates and domain configuration for production-ready HTTPS access
