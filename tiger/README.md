## Purpose

Tiger service processes legal documents (PDFs, Word docs, text files) and extracts structured data including:
- Case information (court, case numbers, parties)
- Legal entities (attorneys, defendants, plaintiffs)
- Factual information and timelines
- Quality metrics and confidence scores

## Features

- Advanced OCR using Docling ML models
- Native Word document processing
- Legal entity extraction and validation
- Multi-document case consolidation
- Hydrated JSON output for Monkey service

```

### Health Check
