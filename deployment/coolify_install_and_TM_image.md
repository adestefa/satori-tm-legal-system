  "server": {
    "platform": "Linux",
    "python_version": "3.12.7",
    "hostname": "c42b086fd02d"
  }
}
```

## Phase 3: TM System Containerization üîç ANALYSIS

### Docker Architecture Created
Developed complete 4-service containerization with Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  tiger:     # ML Document Processing (Python)
  monkey:    # Document Generation (Python)  
  browser:   # PDF Generation (Node.js)
  dashboard: # Web Interface (FastAPI)
```

### Dockerfiles Created
- **dashboard/Dockerfile:** Python 3.11 with FastAPI and dependencies
- **tiger/Dockerfile:** Python 3.11 with ML libraries (Docling, Tesseract, Poppler)
- **monkey/Dockerfile:** Python 3.11 with document generation tools
- **browser/Dockerfile:** Node.js 18 with Chromium (ARM64 compatible)

### Build Process
**Successful Elements:**
- ‚úÖ All Docker images built successfully
- ‚úÖ ARM64 compatibility resolved for Browser service
- ‚úÖ Multi-service orchestration with shared networking
- ‚úÖ Volume management for persistent data
- ‚úÖ Health check configuration

**Challenges Identified:**
1. **Import Path Issues:** Dashboard service failing due to relative imports
   ```
   ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
   ```

2. **Module Structure:** Tiger service CLI entry point incompatible with containerization
   ```
   No module named app.cli.main.__main__
   ```

3. **Service Architecture:** Current services designed for script execution, not containerized web services

### Container Status
```
NAME           STATUS                    ISSUE
tm-dashboard   Restarting (ImportError)  Relative import failures
tm-tiger       Restarting (ModuleError)  CLI entry point issues
